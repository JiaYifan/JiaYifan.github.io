The Event interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). While events are usually triggered by such "external" sources, they can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the HTMLElement.click() method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.
Event 接口表示在 DOM 中发生的任何事件; 一些是用户生成的（例如鼠标或键盘事件），而其他由 API 生成（例如指示动画已经完成运行的事件，视频已被暂停等等）。事件通常由外部源触发，同样也会以编程方式触发，例如执行一个`element`的一个[`HTMLElement.click()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click)方法，或通过定义事件，然后使用[EventTarget.dispatchEvent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent)将其发送到一个指定的目标。有许多类型的事件，其中一些使用基于主要事件接口的其他接口。事件本身包含所有事件通用的属性和方法。

Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or "listen" for) these events, and execute code in response to process (or "handle") them. Event-handlers are usually connected (or "attached") to various HTML elements (such as <button>, <div>, <span>, etc.) using EventTarget.addEventListener(), and this generally replaces using the old HTML event handler attributes. Further, when properly added, such handlers can also be disconnected if needed using removeEventListener(). Note that one element can have several such handlers, even for the exact same event, particularly if separate, independent code modules attach them, each for its own independent purposes (for example, a webpage with an advertising-module and statistics-module both monitoring video-watching). When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event processing can become very complicated -- especially where a parent element receives the very same event as its child elements because "spatially" they overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of such events depends on the Event bubbling and capture settings of each handler triggered.

在事件处理程序中调用 event.preventDefault() 或 event.stopPropagation() 是非常常见的需求。
